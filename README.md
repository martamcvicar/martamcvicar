ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @martamcvicar. I'm a complete programming beginner!

ðŸ‘€ My goal is to learn blockchain developement. At this stage I only have some programming experience from university (which I barely remember now), however my skills are so limited I need to start at the very beginning. For now this is just a hobby, but I hope that in the future I could turn this into a new career.

ðŸŒ± So, over that last few weeks I have drawn out a path that I'm going to follow: 
          - Web Basics: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
          - Frameworks: React/Vue
          - Web3 Front End: Ethers/Moralis
          - OnChain: Solidity

At this stage Iâ€™m learning html, css, and javascript, and once I'm comfortable with those skills, I will be moving through the steps outlined above. I'm aiming to publish all of my work here to build a portfolio so hopefully we will see my skills build and improve over time.
